# Dynamic Image Reflection Generator  

## Description  
This project is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches a random image from an API on each page load. Using JavaScript, the image is processed pixel by pixel to generate a mirrored reflection, creating a dynamic and visually engaging effect.  

## Features  
- Fetches a new random image from an external API on each refresh.  
- Uses JavaScript to process the image pixel by pixel.  
- Generates a horizontally mirrored version of the image.  
- Responsive design using HTML and CSS.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structure of the web page.  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout design.  
- **JavaScript** – Fetching images from an API and processing pixels for reflection.  

## How It Works  
1. The application fetches a random image from an API when the page loads.  
2. JavaScript reads the image data pixel by pixel.  
3. A mirrored version of the image is generated dynamically on an HTML5 `<canvas>`.  
4. The original and mirrored images are displayed together for a visual effect.
